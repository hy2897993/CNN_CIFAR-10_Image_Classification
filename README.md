# Implement and train a Convolutional Neural Networks on CIFAR-10

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are one of the major advancements in computer vision over the past decade. In this project, I will complete a simple CNN architecture from scratch and learn how to implement CNNs with PyTorch, one of the most commonly used deep learning frameworks. I will also run different experiments on imbalanced datasets to evaluate my model and techniques to deal with imbalanced data.
